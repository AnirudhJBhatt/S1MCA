                based in Kozhencherry, a small town in the erstwhile primary state of Travancore (Kerala). In the year
                1887, Muthoot Ninan Mathai (Patron Founder of the group), started in a humble way as a retail and
                whole-sale trader of grains at Kozhencherry. The family partition took place in the year 1979 which led
                to the Genesis of Muthoot George Group (MGG). Over the years business grew gradually into gold loans and
                chits during 1950’s and expanded into Financial Services, Information Technology, Media, Healthcare,
