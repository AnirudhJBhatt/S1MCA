                Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a city in southwest India's coastal Kerala state. It has been a port
                since
                1341,
                when a flood carved out its harbor and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants. Sites
                reflecting
                those
                influences include Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled colonial bungalows and diverse houses of worship.
                Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for centuries.

                Kochi is known as the financial, commercial and industrial capital of Kerala. It has
                the highest GDP as well as the highest GDP per capita in the state. The city is home to the Southern
                Naval Command of the Indian Navy and is the state headquarters of the Indian Coast Guard. Commercial
                maritime facilities of the city include the Port of Kochi, an International Container Transshipment
                Terminal, the Cochin Shipyard, offshore SPM of the BPCL Kochi Refinery and the Kochi Marina. Kochi is
                home for the International Pepper Exchange, Marine Products Export Development Authority, Coconut
                Development Board, companies like HMT, Apollo Tyres, FACT, IREL, Petronet LNG, Kochi Refineries, V-Guard
                and
                industrial parks like the Cochin Special Economic Zone, Smart City, Infopark and Kinfra Hi-Tech Park.
                Kochi
                is home for the High Court of Kerala and Lakshadweep, Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory,
                Indian
                Maritime University, Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University and the Cochin University of Science and
                Technology, and National University of Advanced Legal Studies. Kochi was earlier home to Cochin Stock
                Exchange (CSE).

                Ancient travellers and tradesmen referred to Kochi, variously alluding to it as Cocym, Cochym, Cochin,
                and Kochi. The Cochin Jewish community called Cochin Kogin (Hebrew: קוגין), which is seen in the
                seal of the synagogue owned by the community. The Arab merchants called this place Kashi, which is
                seen in the books such as Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen. The origin of the name Kochi is thought to be the
                Malayalam word kochu azhi, meaning 'small lagoon'. Accounts by Italian explorers Nicolo Conti (15th
                century), and Fra Paoline in the 17th century say that it was called Kochchi, named after the river
                connecting the backwaters to the sea.[citation needed] After the arrival of the Portuguese, and later
                the British, the name Cochin stuck as the official appellation. The city reverted to a closer
                transcription of its original Malayalam name, Kochi, in 1996. This change in name was challenged by the
                city municipal corporation but the court later dismissed the plea.

                Muziris, a port somewhere north of Kochi (mostly identified with Kodungallur in Thrissur district), was
                the centre of Indian spice trade for many centuries, and was known to the Arabs, Yavanas (Greeks and
                Romans) as well as Jews, Syrians, and Chinese since ancient times.[38] Kochi rose to significance as a
                trading centre after the port Muziris around Kodungallur (Cranganore) was destroyed by the massive
                flooding of Periyar in 1341. The earliest documented references to Kochi occur in books written by
                Chinese voyager Ma Huan during his visit to Kochi in the 15th century as part of Admiral Zheng He's
                treasure fleet. There are also references to Kochi in accounts written by Italian traveller Niccolò
                Da Conti, who visited Kochi in 1440. The ruler of Perumpadappu (near Ponnani) fled to Kodungallur in
                the early medieval period, when the Zamorin of Calicut annexed Ponnani region, after Tirunavaya war.
                They later moved to Kochi and established the Kingdom of Cochin. When Vasco Da Gama landed at
                Kozhikode and the Zamorin of Calicut fought against the Portuguese with Kunjali Marakkar, the ruler of
                Cochin aligned with the Portuguese.
