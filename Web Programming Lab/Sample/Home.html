            <h2>Principalâ€™s Message</h2>
            <p>
                At the outset, I must thank you for choosing Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science as your
                preferred destination for launching yourself as an engineering professional. As engineering
                professionals, we are bound to provide technological solutions to the world at large. At MITS, its our
                endeavour to create an ambience that would expose students to problems early on, and train them to be
                solution providers. Towards this aim, we have created a magnificent infrastructure, comprising of
                well-equipped laboratories, libraries, classrooms, seminar halls, cafeterias, playgrounds and hostels.
                We have expert teachers from varying disciplines to guide you through every step. There are plenty of
                avenues to showcase your curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular talent, and some links in this
                website would provide you a glimpse of those possibilities as well. Additionally, inadequacies in
                existing curriculum are compensated with add-on courses and other specialist industry-guided
                initiatives. A large pool of students who pursue higher studies after qualifying at GATE, also is a
                direct indication that our ambience is perfect for multiple roles promoting life-long learning. It is no
                wonder then, that MITS is one of the preferred destinations for companies searching for young talented
                professionals. I look forward to your suggestions on how to improve our campus and make it a dream
                destination for young budding graduates.
